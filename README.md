module 2 project
This repository contains the code for my personal developer portfolio website. It serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and achievements, providing potential employers and clients with an overview of my capabilities as a developer. The website is designed to be visually appealing, user-friendly, and responsive across various devices and screen sizes.
